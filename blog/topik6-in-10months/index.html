            <p>This post details my journey of learning the Korean language from complete beginner to TOPIK 6 in
                approximately 10 months. I'll try to be as detailed as possible about my experience and strategies.</p>

            <p>In January 2023, I received the Global Korea Scholarship for a Software Engineering degree at Ajou
                University in South Korea. Since studying in Korea required Korean proficiency, I began learning the
                language that same month.</p>

            <h2>Starting Out: The Foundation Phase</h2>
            <p>As a first step, I enrolled in two basic Korean courses from different learning centers in Myanmar, both
                conducted online. Looking back, I should point out that taking two separate courses for Korean basics
                was unnecessary—one would have been sufficient.</p>

            <p>After about two months of study, I arrived in Korea at the end of February 2023 to begin my Korean
                Language Course at Ajou University. Despite completing two basic courses in Myanmar, I couldn't skip
                Level 1 in Korea and had to start all over again. This experience made me realize that to learn a
                language as quickly and effectively as possible, immersion is key—living in the country where the
                language is spoken makes all the difference. It's all about the environment.</p>

            <h2>The Intensive Learning Phase</h2>
            <p>I started the Level 1 course at Ajou in March 2023. However, unlike most of my classmates, I decided to
                attempt the TOPIK II test during my Level 2 studies, which is still below intermediate level. As
                expected, TOPIK was much more difficult than I had imagined, but I pushed through and achieved TOPIK
                Level 3—the minimum requirement to begin degree coursework in Software Engineering at Ajou University.
                Students have one year to reach TOPIK Level 3 before starting the degree program, and I accomplished
                this in just five months.</p>

            <p>For my second attempt, I took TOPIK II again during my Level 3 language course in September. In fact, I
                took two TOPIK II tests during my Level 3 semester—one in September and another in October. I achieved
                TOPIK 5 and TOPIK 6, respectively. This progression happened within 10 months of starting my Korean
                language studies.</p>

            <h2>My TOPIK Preparation Strategy</h2>
            <p>Here's how I approached TOPIK preparation at different stages:</p>

            <h3>First Attempt (Level 2 → TOPIK 3)</h3>
            <p>Until Level 2, I primarily focused on school lectures and textbooks. I didn't stress too much about
                understanding every vocabulary word and grammar point in the TOPIK test. During the Listening and
                Reading sections, I maintained full attention while being mindful of time limits, checking the clock
                every 5 to 10 minutes.</p>

            <p>The crucial point for these sections is that you can't waste time trying to understand every question and
                passage 100%—that's not the main objective. The goal is to select the correct answer. If you're unsure,
                make your best guess and move on to the next question. Don't let stress overwhelm you during the exam.
                Maintaining a calm mindset is essential.</p>

            <p>For the Writing section, since I didn't know most Korean words in the test, producing quality writing
                within the 50-minute time limit was impossible. So I made a strategic decision to skip question 54,
                which comprises the main part of the writing test and accounts for 50% of the total writing marks.
                Instead, I focused on questions 51, 52, and 53.</p>

            <h3>Second and Third Attempts (Level 3 → TOPIK 5 & 6)</h3>
            <p>For my second and third TOPIK attempts, I dedicated 60-70% of my time to school lectures and only 30-40%
                to TOPIK test preparation (timing practice, strategy development, etc.). By this time, I was in Level 3
                of my school curriculum and could understand about 50-60% of the words in TOPIK.</p>

            <p>For the Writing test, I allocated my time strategically:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>3 minutes</strong> for question 51</li>
                <li><strong>5 minutes</strong> for question 52</li>
                <li><strong>12 minutes</strong> for question 53</li>
                <li><strong>30 minutes</strong> for question 54</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The key to my success was maintaining focus on my regular Korean studies while strategically preparing
                for the test format and timing constraints.</p>
